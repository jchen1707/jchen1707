### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's James. I'm a second year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I've interned as a Data Engineer at [Purolator](https://www.purolator.com/en) and [Employment & Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html). I like to make projects inspired by my interests and problems. I'm learning Full Stack Development & Machine Learning! You can find me here on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameschen416/).
