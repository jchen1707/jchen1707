### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's James. I'm a third-year (3B) Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I've interned as a Data Engineer at [Purolator](https://www.purolator.com/en) and [Employment & Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) as well as a Software Engineer at [Healthcare Systems R&A](http://www.healthcare-systems.ca/), [Swan Cloud](https://swanchain.io/) and [Mircom](https://mircom.com/). I like to make projects inspired by my interests and problems. You can find me here on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameschen416/). I am currently seeking Summer 2025 Internships!
