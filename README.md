### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's James. I'm a second-year(2B) Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I've interned as a Data Engineer at [Purolator](https://www.purolator.com/en) and [Employment & Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) as well as a Software Engineer at [Healthcare Systems R&A](http://www.healthcare-systems.ca/). I like to make projects inspired by my interests and problems. I'm currently seeking Winter 2024 Internships. You can find me here on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameschen416/).
