### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's James. I'm a fourth-year (4A) Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I specialize in backend development and distributed systems. I've interned as a Data Engineer at [Purolator](https://www.purolator.com/en) and [Employment & Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) as well as a Software Engineer at [Healthcare Systems R&A](http://www.healthcare-systems.ca/), [Swan Cloud](https://swanchain.io/), [Mircom](https://mircom.com/) and [StackAdapt](https://www.stackadapt.com/).
